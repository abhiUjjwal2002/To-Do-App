# Simple Java To-Do App

This project is a simple to-do application built entirely in Java. It utilizes Java's core functionalities including `java.swing` and `java.awt` for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) and managing user interactions. This is a great project for implementing my learning about JAVA and the app will be updated as i continue to encounter new methods in my development journey.
